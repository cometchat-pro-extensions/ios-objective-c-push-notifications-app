# Installation 
      
   Simply clone the project from iOS-swift-chat-app repository. After cloning the repository navigate to project's folder and use below command to install the require pods.
   
   ```
   $ pod install
   ```
   Build and run the Sample App.
   
   ### Note : 
   If you are using Swift v4.2 then use pod ```CometChatPro_Swift4.2``` or using Swift v5.0 then use pod ```CometChatPro``` inside the project's podfile.
   
   ### Add CometChatPro SDK in project
   
   ### CocoaPods:
   
   We recommend using CocoaPods, as they are the most advanced way of managing iOS project dependencies. Open a terminal   window, move to your project directory, and then update the SDK  by running the following command.
   
   ```
   $ pod install
   ```
   
   If the pod installation fails due to Cocoapods dependancy issue then use the below command to install the framework through cocoapods.
  
  ```
   pod install --repo-update
   ```
   
   ### Manually:
   
   You can download the CometChatPro SDK from link below and manually add it in the project.
   
   Download CometChatPro SDK from [ios-chat-sdk](https://github.com/cometchat-pro/ios-chat-sdk)
